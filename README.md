Having started my journey by learning a bit of HTML/CSS and JavaScript with a bootcamp in 2021 with [Bath Spa University](https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/courses/short-courses/skills-bootcamps/) and the [Instute of Coding](https://instituteofcoding.org/), I continued my self study, encouraged by a friend to look into Python and deepening my comprehension of Javascript at the same time.

My move from the UK to France at the end of 2022 allowed me the opportunity to focus on my desire to transition from my work in Hospitality and Cheffing into the tech sector.

Since September 2024 I have begun my apprenticeship working at Ubisoft as a Web Developper, where I am getting some amazing experience working with teams based all over the world.
Alongside my work at Ubisoft I am working on a side-project for attaining my RNCP 6 - Concepteur Developpeur de Logiciel in 2025.
