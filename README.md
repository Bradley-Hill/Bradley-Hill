- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bradley M.Hill

- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Javascript and breaking into the world of Software Development, along with Fantasy Books, a splash of Gaming
- and a whole heap of cooking!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning software development at Ada Tech School in Nantes, and on the side undertaking The Odin Project, whilst constantly pushing my knowledge of HTML,CSS and Javascript, and more recently starting to make headway into the back-end and creating my first REST API.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that people think I could help them with! From proofreading text to helping on any project, I'm keen to be helpful as together, we learn better.
