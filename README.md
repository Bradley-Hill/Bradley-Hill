Hi, I'm Bradley — a **junior web developer** currently based in France.

I started my coding journey in 2021 through a bootcamp with [Bath Spa University](https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/courses/short-courses/skills-bootcamps/) and the [Institute of Coding](https://instituteofcoding.org/), where I learned the basics of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

I kept learning through self-study, exploring Python and diving deeper into JavaScript, supported by a friend who encouraged me to dig further into development.

At the end of 2022, I moved from the UK to France to fully focus on transitioning from a career in **hospitality and cheffing** into the **tech industry**.

After completing a contract as a **Junior Web Developer at Ubisoft** *(Sep 2024 – Nov 2025)*, where I worked on the marketing websites for the company interacting with international teams, I’m now focused on continuing my journey as a **software developer**.
