Hi, I'm Bradley — a **junior web developer** currently based in France.

I started my coding journey in 2021 through a bootcamp with [Bath Spa University](https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/courses/short-courses/skills-bootcamps/) and the [Institute of Coding](https://instituteofcoding.org/), where I learned the basics of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

I kept learning through self-study, exploring Python and diving deeper into JavaScript, supported by a friend who encouraged me to dig further into development.

At the end of 2022, I moved from the UK to France to fully focus on transitioning from a career in **hospitality and cheffing** into the **tech industry**.

Since **September 2024**, I’ve been working as a **junior web developer at Ubisoft**, gaining hands-on experience working on real-world projects with international teams.

Alongside my work at Ubisoft, I’m also building a side project as part of my studies toward the **RNCP Level 6 – Concepteur Développeur de Logiciel**, which I’ll complete in 2025.

## 🚀 Looking Ahead

I’m actively growing my skills and will be available for a **junior developer role starting from November 2025**, once my apprenticeship ends.
