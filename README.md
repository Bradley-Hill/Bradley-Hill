- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bradley M.Hill
-
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, building websites and breaking into the world of Front End Development, along with Fantasy Books, a splash of Gaming
- and a whole heap of cooking!
-
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and undertaking The Odin Project, whilst constantly pushing my knowledge of HTML and CSS.
-
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that people think I could help them with! From proofreading textx to helping on a front end project or
- basic Python projects, I'm keen to be helpful, together, we learn better.
-
- 📫 How to reach me (https://bradley-hill.github.io/) is a work in progress, but the contact me links all should be working!
